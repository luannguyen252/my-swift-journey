## SwiftUI

> SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform. Create beautiful, dynamic apps faster than ever before.

SwiftUI is an innovative new way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms, so you can create better apps with less code. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of SwiftUI code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written.

import SwiftUI

// Using this to provide .lightContent status bar style
class HostingController<T: View>: UIHostingController<T> {
    override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
        return .lightContent
    }
}
```

---

## Use HEX Colors

```swift
import SwiftUI

prefix operator ⋮
prefix func ⋮(hex:UInt32) -> Color {
    return Color(hex)
}

extension Color {
    init(_ hex: UInt32, opacity:Double = 1.0) {
        let red = Double((hex & 0xff0000) >> 16) / 255.0
        let green = Double((hex & 0xff00) >> 8) / 255.0

    return Color($0)
}
```

Use: `.foregroundColor(Color(0x111111))`
